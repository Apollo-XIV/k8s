# 1-1: Simple Service Deployment

**Objective**: Deploy a simple webapp which connects to a supabase server as well as interacting with an API backend
server. All of these should be deployed with persistent data where required, and accessible as expected from outside
the cluster, using ingress to provide an entrypoint.

**The Webapp**: A simple open chat room with user authentication

## Specs
**Frontend**: Next.js with typescript and react
**Backend**: Actix Web or Rocket.rs (Rust based api library)
**Supabase**: Open Source BaaS, modified to fit purpose
