# k8s

This is a simple dump repo for me to place assorted kubernetes files in, I'm working on learning kubernetes so there'll be a number of workspaces in here to demonstrate different setups.

For the most part I'll be using minikube to host the clusters locally, however, in future I may start experimenting with live deployments and pairing k8s with terraform
